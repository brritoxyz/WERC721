     * [WARNING]
     * ====
     * While an open way of calling {_snapshot} is required for certain trust minimization mechanisms such as forking,
     * you must consider that it can potentially be used by attackers in two ways.
     *
     * First, it can be used to increase the cost of retrieval of values from snapshots, although it will grow
     * logarithmically thus rendering this attack ineffective in the long term. Second, it can be used to target
     * specific accounts and increase the cost of ERC20 transfers for them, in the ways specified in the Gas Costs
     * section above.
     *
     * We haven't measured the actual numbers; if this is something you're interested in please reach out to us.
